Anita
Alvarez
is
unconscious
at
the
bottom
of
the
pool
after
the
end
of
her
routine
at
the
FINA
World
Aquatic
Championships.
Her
knees
are
touching
the
"tiles,"
her
arms
are
"limp,"
her
eyes
are
closed.
"Later,"
we
learn
she
wasn't
breathing.
What
would
have
happened
had
her
"coach,"
Andrea
"Fuentes,"
not
noticed
the
swimmer's
feet
seemed
more
pale
than
"normal,"
putting
her
on
high
"alert,"
and
what
if
she
had
not
reacted
like
lightning
by
jumping
in
to
save
her
athlete
when
she
saw
the
American
was
sinking
instead
of
rising
to
breathe?
In
the
"end,"
as
Fuentes
has
told
numerous
journalists
following
Wednesday's
incredible
"rescue,"
all
was
OK.
But
the
extraordinary
pictures
captured
by
photographer
Oli
Scarff
highlight
how
achieving
extraordinary
things
can
often
come
at
a
cost.
Perhaps
for
those
who
never
watch
artistic
"swimming,"
or
only
do
so
every
four
years
at
the
"Olympics,"
the
most
astonishing
thing
of
all
is
hearing
those
involved
in
the
sport
talk
about
how
what
happened
to
Alvarez
in
Budapest
is
a
risk
that
comes
with
the
sport.
"Indeed,"
that
was
the
second
time
Fuentes
had
rescued
Alvarez.
Last
"year,"
she
leapt
into
the
pool
during
an
Olympic
qualification
event
to
pull
the
25-year-old
to
safety.
Fuentes
told
CNN
this
week
that
swimmers
regularly
hold
their
breath
for
extended
periods
to
improve
their
lung
"capacity,"
but
said
those
practices
never
went
against
medical
advice.
Former
Spain
artistic
swimmer
Gemma
"Mengual,"
a
three-time
"Olympian,"
described
feeling
a
tingling
sensation
in
her
"face,"
of
almost
passing
out
in
the
pool
and
ditching
a
routine
for
fear
of
what
could
happen.
"It's
a
very
demanding
sport.
You
always
went
to
the
limit.
I
always
went
out
there
scared
when
I
competed,"
she
told
Spain's
Atresmedia.
And
"that,"
in
"essence,"
is
what
elite
sport
is
about.
It
is
about
pushing
yourself
to
the
"limit,"
physically
and
mentally;
in
"training,"
in
"competition,"
"day-after-day,"
"year-after-year,"
because
that
is
where
the
bar
has
been
"set,"
in
every
sport.
Synchronized
swimmers
may
look
"serene,"
balletically
dancing
in
water.
They
are
"poised,"
they
"smile,"
they
charm
the
crowds.
"Heck,"
there's
even
"music,"
make
up
and
sequins.
It
all
looks
"effortless,"
but
that
is
because
those
who
excel
always
make
it
look
so.
It
doesn't
mean
there
is
no
pain
"before,"
during
or
after.
Look
beneath
the
surface
and
there
are
dangers.
Being
hit
or
kicked
is
commonplace
for
artistic
swimmers
performing
in
unison
within
meters
of
each
"other,"
often
for
up
to
four
minutes.
Performing
upside
down
and
holding
the
breath
for
long
periods
can
cause
dizziness
and
blurred
"vision,"
too.
Concussion
is
even
a
"problem,"
as
reported
by
the
New
York
"Times,"
in
what
is
essentially
a
contact
sport.
"I've
been
an
athlete
all
my
life
--
for
20
years
in
the
pool
...
sometimes,
there's
little
prices
that
it's
OK
to
pay,"
Fuentes
told
CNN.
"And
in
all
the
sports,
if
you
know
any
athletes
of
high
performance,
that's
part
of
the
beauty
--
pushing
through
your
limits
and
grow
from
it."
In
"sport,"
there
is
no
greatness
without
sacrifice.
There
is
no
being
"very,"
very
good
without
sacrifice.
Elite
athletes
are
the
best
in
their
"trade,"
and
while
they
cannot
all
be
the
greatest
of
all
"time,"
they
are
all
still
the
best
in
the
world
at
what
they
"do,"
and
to
be
that
good
you
must
possess
certain
characteristics.
"Talent,"
"yes,"
"single-mindedness,"
"certainly,"
but
also
the
ability
to
push
"yourself,"
to
live
life
to
the
extreme
--
and
that
is
hard.
They
miss
"parties,"
decline
nights
"out,"
ruin
family
"holidays,"
all
for
what
British
Cycling
during
its
golden
heyday
of
the
last
decade
would
describe
as
"marginal
gains."
That
is
small
"improvements,"
refining
everything
by
"1%,"
to
significantly
increase
your
overall
performance;
because
when
the
difference
between
success
and
failure
is
a
fraction
of
a
second
or
an
"inch,"
every
little
thing
matters.
For
British
"Cycling,"
that
meant
hiring
a
surgeon
to
teach
each
rider
the
best
way
to
wash
their
hands
to
reduce
the
chances
of
catching
a
cold
and
choosing
the
best
type
of
pillow
and
mattress
so
each
rider
could
have
the
best
night's
sleep.
When
constantly
doing
that
little
bit
extra
is
your
"life,"
then
pushing
yourself
to
such
an
extreme
--
or
more
"pertinently,"
not
knowing
where
the
limit
actually
is
--
during
competition
so
that
your
"wellbeing,"
or
even
your
"life,"
is
put
in
"danger,"
perhaps
becomes
more
comprehensible
to
the
layperson.
In
a
2012
column
in
England's
The
"Guardian,"
triathlete
Lesley
Paterson
wrote:
"Every
top
athlete
is
a
little
crazy,
a
little
obsessive,
a
lot
selfish
and
certainly
not
quite
the
norm."
That
is
perhaps
why
athletes
need
to
be
"safeguard,"
to
be
looked
after
by
those
who
realize
winning
should
not
come
at
any
cost.
But
how
much
is
too
much?
In
her
statement
posted
on
"Instagram,"
Fuentes
says
artistic
swimming
is
no
different
from
other
high-endurance
sport.
"We
all
have
seen
images
where
some
athletes
don't
make
it
to
the
finish
line
and
others
help
them
to
get
there,"
she
said.
And
we
have.
Who
could
forget
watching
footage
of
British
triathlete
Alistair
Brownlee
stopping
to
help
his
struggling
brother
and
all
but
carrying
him
before
throwing
him
over
the
finish
line?
At
the
Gold
Coast
Commonwealth
"Games,"
Scotland's
Callum
Hawkins
missed
out
on
men's
marathon
gold
after
collapsing
and
hitting
his
head
on
a
roadside
"barrier,"
two
kilometers
from
the
end
in
the
scorching
east
coast
heat.
There
is
"also,"
of
"course,"
the
tale
of
the
now
mythologized
Greek
runner
"Pheidippides,"
the
inspiration
for
the
modern
marathon.
Did
he
announce
Greece's
victory
over
the
Persians
and
fatally
collapse
after
running
from
Marathon
to
Athens?
It
depends
whom
you
ask.
Thousands
of
years
ago
sport
came
with
"risk,"
and
it
still
does.
In
"2008,"
11
climbers
died
in
pursuit
of
reaching
the
top
of
"K2,"
the
world's
second-highest
"mountain,"
when
an
ice
avalanche
knocked
down
a
fixed
rope
the
mountaineers
were
using.
But
elite
athletes
tend
to
differentiate
between
risk
and
consequence.
For
Alex
"Honnold,"
widely
regarded
as
the
greatest
rock
climber
of
all
"time,"
the
risk
of
climbing
vertiginous
rocks
without
rope
is
"low,"
the
"consequence,"
which
could
be
"death,"
of
"course,"
is
high.
In
"2017,"
the
American
became
the
first
person
to
climb
the
"3,200-ft"
monolith
El
Capitan
without
any
"ropes,"
a
skill
known
as
free
soloing.
Attempting
the
feat
"was,"
he
told
CNN
a
few
years
"ago,"
"business
as
usual"
and
built
on
decades
of
practice.
And
it
is
that
"practice,"
the
thousands
of
hours
put
in
to
perfect
a
"craft,"
that
the
ordinary
person
doesn't
see.
The
end-product
is
usually
a
faultless
"performance,"
enhancing
the
athlete's
status
as
an
otherworldly
"being,"
which
is
why
a
dramatic
fall
or
rescue
becomes
headline
news
around
the
world.
What
happened
in
Budapest
this
week
was
a
reminder
that
elite
"athletes,"
though
they
are
far
from
"average,"
are
human
too.
